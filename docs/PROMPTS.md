## PR #1 — chore/m0-bootstrap (M0 process bedrock)

- **Driver:** Imree (direction, approvals, repo/remote setup) · **Author:** Claude (terminal) ·
  **Reviewer:** Antigravity (cross-model) + Eyal.
- **Context:** Phase 0 (book v3.0.0 absorbed: clarification page, App C/D/E/F, ch.2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9;
  kit verified; reference repo studied; rubric V3 diffed vs HW6) → Phase 1 decision grill
  (topics a–h + creativity round, each decision argued and approved one-by-one) → Phase 2 gated
  docs (PRD v2, PLAN, TODO, CLAUDE.md + ports plan — each explicitly approved by Imree; PRD/PLAN
  cross-model-reviewed pre-repo, findings adjudicated with sources).
- **This PR:** repo scaffolding (uv/pyproject/quality config), CI workflow + six gate scripts
  (file sizes, anti-patterns, no-hardcoded, sync-core manifest, self-grade validation, submission
  checklist), five adapted skills (eval-harness + self-grade rewritten for this project's
  inversions; HW6's "pipeline not strategy" and "repo is public" lines deliberately removed),
  approved PRD/PLAN/TODO/CLAUDE.md landed, ADR-0001/0002, process templates, package skeletons +
  version tests. Everything adapted from HW6 was audited line-by-line per the porting rule —
  nothing blind-copied.
